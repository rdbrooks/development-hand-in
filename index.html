    <h1>Development Assignment</h1>
    <div>
      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this assignment, I used React to build an interactive music-related
        interface with filter, sort and aggregation capabilities. In addition, I
        practiced conducting a competitive analysis that compares websites with
        different favoriting features, thus forming the foundation for my own
        implementation.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The competitive analysis examines the favoritng function of Pinterest,
        the New York Times and Spotify. The red boxes highlight how one can
        favorite and unfavorite an element as well as how the favorites are
        displayed for each website.
      </p>
      <div id="pinterest">
        <h3>Pinterest (Favorite Pins)</h3>
        <p>Access Pinterest <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">here</a>!</p>

        <h3>Competitive Comparison Chart</h3>
        <p>
          In summary, doing this competitive analysis was useful to understand
          what features were most and least successful.

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
          Drawing inspiration from my competitive analysis, the features that I
          attempted to implement included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Button for every element to add and remove from aggregated</li>
          <li>Button filled in when element in aggregator</li>
          <li>
            Songs in aggregator based on when they were liked (most recently
            liked first)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        My app allows users to explore global top songs through filtering by
        song length and genre as well as sorting by release date. Users can like
        songs, which will aggregate in the Liked Songs section of the interface,
        which also displays a total of how many songs are liked.

        Access my app
        <a href="https://react-music-app-sable.vercel.app/">here</a>! I really
        enjoyed completing this assignment becase I had not previously used
        React to build an interface with filtering and sorting. In addition, I
        now have a stronger understanding of components and states in React.
