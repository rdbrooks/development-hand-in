    <h1>Development Assignment</h1>
    <div>
      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this assignment, I conducted a competitive analysis comparing
        websites with different favoriting functionality, which formed the
        foundation of my own implementaiton of an aggregator. I used React to
        build an interactive music interface with filter, sort and aggregation
        capabilities.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The competitive analysis examines favoriting functionality in Pinterest,
        the New York Times and Spotify. These websites are linked below, and the
        red annotations highlight how one can favorite and unfavorite an element
        as well as how the favorites are displayed for each website.

        <p>
          Using a bookmark or heart icon to add items to favorites proved highly
          effective because this metaphor made the icon's purpose easily
          understandable to users. In addition showing outlined or filled-in
          icons based on whether the item was in the favorites list was
          successful becuase it indicated clickability and visually conveyed
          favoriting status to users. Having the word "favorite" appear upon
          hover, as seen in Pinterest, was also beneficial from an accessibility
          standpoint as it provided two ways to communicate the button's purpose
          (visual and textual). Furthermore, ensuring the icon was always
          visible to indicate liked items, as done in Spotify, made the website
          glanceable. On the other hand, Pinterest and the New York Times
          websites were more time-consuming to use because users had to click
          into each item to determine its favoriting status when not viewing the
          aggregated list. Another unsuccessful aspect was Pinterest using
          favorites as a filter instead of having a separate location for the
          aggregator. This approach made it challenging to find favorites
          because it was more intuitive to expect them to be aggregated across
          the entire website.

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
          Drawing inspiration from my competitive analysis, the features that I
          will attempt to implement include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An icon next to every element that adds the element to the favorites
            list when clicked and removes the element from the favorites list
            when clicked again
          </li>
          <li>
            Icon visually filled in when the element is in the favorites list
            and outlined when the element is not in the favorites list
          </li>
          <li>
            Order of songs in aggregator based on when they were liked, with the
            most recently liked songs at the top
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The theme of my app is music, and it allows users to explore global top
        songs. Users can filter songs by length (minutes) and genre, and sort
        them by release date. Additionally, users can like songs by clicking the
        heart icon. Liked songs are displayed in the Liked Songs section of the
        interface, and the total count of liked songs is also updated
        accordingly.

        Access my app
        <a href="https://react-music-app-sable.vercel.app/">here</a>! This
        project was my first time using React to build an interface with
        filtering and sorting, and I now feel like I have a stronger
        understanding of components and states in React. I'm excited to use
        React again in future projects!
